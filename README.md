# flask_4_databases_mysql_vm

## The VM and MySQL setup process.

I followed everything you did during class and got everything to work, even the parts in google cloud shell. But even after setting the addresses in google cloud shell to 0.0.0.0 I couldn't connect to MySQL (which will be seen in my screenshots.) I then tried again on Sunday, remade everything and worked through google cloud shell again, but that didn't work so I thought to take a break until yesterday. I once again tried again, making sure to follow the slides, and I still couldn't get any of those to work. I ended up deleting my Virtual Machines, except the original one I started with. It was kinda frustrating not being able to get this work even though I was following the instructions to a T. There was only one issue that I ran into which was that we had different sizes for our virtual machines, but I kept above the minimum RAM.

## The rationale behind your database schema.

Ideally, the schema that I've set up would've had primary keys and foreign keys and they would connect based on similar columns. 

## Steps and challenges from the database migration process.
